- 👋 Hi, I’m Zak
- 👀 I’m interested in getting into software development, but have my options open with various other tech careers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, slowly working my way through the Harvard CS50 curriculum as of right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to grow my knowledge and find a direction I truly want to pursue in the tech world.
- 📫 Email is probably the best way to reach me, I am still learning exactly how Github works.
