- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZiMP45
- 👀 I’m interested in getting into software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, mostly javascript right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, just looking for guidance!
- 📫 How to reach me on here is best if that's an option, still learning how it works.
